# yolo-rt-obj-detection
Realtime Object Detection using YOLO Darketnet

Pre-Requisites:
You need to download, pre-trained darknet weight file by running below command.

wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights

How to run this project?

python main.py --video=test.mp4
python main.py --image=<ImageFilePath>
  
In this project, we are using pre-trained convolution neural network called Darknet which uses YOLO algorithm for object detection in image. If you are interested to know details about darknet here is the link: https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
